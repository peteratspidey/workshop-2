## if and else
> this is a conditional loop where if one condition is not satisfied then move to the second condition

if condition == true:
  run the code body and dont move the code ahead
  print()
if condition != true:
run the elif condition:
if elif condition is == true
    run the code body and dont move ahead
if elif != true:
run the else condition
if else == true:
  run the code body and break the loop
if else != true:
  break

## loop
### while
> repeat until condition is false

### if
> execute at once condition is true

### for
> repeat untill given fix no of times
> faster than the while+if loop
